# 2D-Cutting-Machine
For this project, the goal of my 2D Cutting machine is to use the motion control for two different motors to provide clear cutes. The key feature of my project is that it provides solutions for all of the challenges in the assignment, homing position, Serial Input and simple G-Code parsing, and Simultaneous movement for the motor. For the Homing position, the system uses two push buttons that simulate limit switches. Once the system is started, it executes directly the Homing method, moving both motors individually until they reached their respective limit switch. The system would only start after homing. For the coordinates, the user needs to write in the Serial monitor a coordinate in the form of P1 X1 Y1, being P the point number, X1 the displacement in the x axis and Y1 the one in the y axis. This tries to resemble the parsing of G-code for CNC machines. Additionally, the system can move both motors at the same time for diagonal cutting.
